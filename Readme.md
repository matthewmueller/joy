⚠️  Joy development is currently **on hold**. Recent Go -> WASM developments look like a more promising path to Go being a great choice for frontend development. I'm thrilled to see development moving so quickly now and I think our efforts are better spent improving the Go to WASM compiler. As for Joy, there are quite a few interesting nuggets of code in here that I'd encourage you to dig up, polish and open source 😊

Thanks for your interest in this project!

## Getting Started

**1. Install Joy:**

```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewmueller/joy/master/install.sh | sh
```

> Note: you can also download from the [releases tab](https://github.com/matthewmueller/joy/releases).

**2. Create a `main.go` file with the following code:**

```go
package main

func main() {
  println("hi world!")
}
```

**3. Run the code in a real browser:**

```sh
joy run main.go
```

**4. See the compiled Javascript:**

```sh
joy main.go
```

## Examples

Visit https://mat.tm/joy/#examples or peruse the [test suite](https://github.com/matthewmueller/joy/tree/master/testdata).

## Using the CLI

**Compile Go into Javascript:**

```
joy <main.go>
```

**Compile and run the Go code in headless chrome:**

```
joy run <main.go>
```

**Build a development version of the code:**

```
joy build --dev <main.go>...
```

**Build a production version of the code (coming soon!):**

```
joy build <main.go>...
```

**Start a development server with livereload:**

```
joy serve <main.go>...
```

> Run `joy help` for additional details.

## Contributing

So happy to hear you're interested in contributing! Here's a quick rundown of how to get setup:

**Setup**

1. Make sure you have the Go environment setup on your computer. There are quite a few better resources online on how to do that

2. `go get -u -v github.com/matthewmueller/joy/...` to install the compiler from source

3. `go test -v` to run all the tests

**Links and tips:**

- https://astexplorer.net/: I've been using this to figure out how to build the JS tree
- http://goast.yuroyoro.net/ : Simple Go AST viewer
- https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/es5.md: Link to the ES3 AST format, this is implemented in [syntax.go](internal/jsast/syntax.go)
- https://golang.org/ref/spec: You may need to refer to this to see what types are possible in Go's AST
- To run all tests: `go test -v`
- To run individual tests: `go test -v -run Test/08`
- `pretty.Println(ast)` will pretty print the JS AST (requires [this package](https://github.com/kr/pretty))
- `ast.Print(nil, node)` will pretty print the Go AST
